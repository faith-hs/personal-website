    "text": "About this Project\nAs part of the BSA Tennis Consulting Club at UCLA, I have taken on some other projects on top of my responsibilities as a tagging team lead and analyst. One of these projects is the feature engineering project. As the club has begun to transition to AI systems for data creation, some features are not readily available with the software the club utilises, warranting feature engineering of said features. More on this project can be seen [here]."

    "text": "The Comparative Study on Tire Performance was a study done for the STATS 140XP final project. This study looked at publicly available data from IMSA, specifically the Lamborghini Supertrofeo North America cup, to determine if one tire brand performs better than the other. For as long as this category of racing existed, tires have been distributed by Pirelli. However, the beginning of the 2023 season marked the beginning of a new era with all cars across this category switching to Hankook tires. This study aimed to determine which of the two tires performed better. More on this study can be found [here]."
