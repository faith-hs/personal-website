## About Me

**Hi there!** \
My name is Faith Satrya, I am a recent graduate of the Statistics and Data Science B.S. program at UCLA. My studies have enhanced my interest in being able to perform data analyses in many different contexts to inform solutions. I currently work part-time as a tennis instructor, specialising in teaching children between the ages of 5-14. While incredibly passionate about this job, I am currently looking for full-time employment in a field where I can apply the skills I obtained during my time at UCLA. \
